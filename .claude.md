# Full Website Audit & Design Polish - Didriksson.no

## Context
Norwegian web development agency website (didriksson.no) launching in 2 hours for paid marketing campaign. Need complete audit and polish before launch.

## Current Status
- ✅ GDPR compliant (Plausible analytics, cookie consent, privacy policy)
- ✅ Mobile optimized (viewport, manifest.json, responsive)
- ✅ Performance optimized (lazy loading, Next/Image with AVIF/WebP)
- ✅ SEO strong (structured data, sitemap, meta tags)
- ✅ December offer implemented (10,000 kr vs 15,000 kr)

## Problems to Fix

### CRITICAL VISUAL ISSUES:
1. **Hero section pricing box** - Currently looks terrible (see screenshot):
   - Green box styling is off
   - Typography hierarchy needs work
   - Spacing/padding issues
   - Dark mode compatibility

2. **Overall design audit needed**:
   - Check ALL spacing and padding consistency
   - Verify color contrast (especially dark mode)
   - Button sizes and hover states
   - Typography scale and hierarchy
   - Border radius consistency
   - Shadow usage

### Areas to Review:

**Components to audit:**
- `/` - Hero section (main landing)
- `/tjenester` - Pricing cards
- `/eksempler` - Example pages
- `/case` - Case study (Bluecrew)
- All CTAs and buttons
- Mobile navigation
- Footer
- Cookie consent banner

**Design System Check:**
- Consistent spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
- Color palette usage (ocean blues, emerald greens for offer)
- Typography hierarchy (h1-h6, body, small)
- Component states (hover, active, focus, disabled)
- Border radius (consistent rounded corners)
- Shadows (consistent depth)

**Mobile Experience:**
- Touch targets (min 44x44px)
- Readable font sizes (min 16px for body)
- Proper spacing on small screens
- Navigation usability
- Forms and inputs

**December Offer Highlighting:**
- Make the 10,000 kr offer stand out MORE
- Professional, not salesy
- Clear value proposition
- Consistent across all pages

## Technical Constraints
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (@tailwindcss inline syntax)
- Norwegian language (keep all copy in Norwegian)
- Must maintain GDPR compliance
- Keep performance optimizations

## Success Criteria
1. **Professional & Clean** - Looks like a 50k+ website, not cheap
2. **Conversion-focused** - Clear CTAs, easy booking flow
3. **Mobile-first** - Perfect on all screen sizes
4. **Fast** - Lighthouse score 95+ on all metrics
5. **Trust-building** - Professional, credible, not salesy

## Specific Tasks

### 1. Fix Hero Section Pricing Box
Current file: `components/HeroA.tsx`
- Make the December offer box stunning
- Better visual hierarchy
- Proper contrast and readability
- Works in light AND dark mode

### 2. Polish All Components
- Audit every component for visual consistency
- Fix spacing issues
- Ensure proper hover/focus states
- Mobile responsiveness check

### 3. Typography & Hierarchy
- Clear visual hierarchy throughout
- Proper font weights and sizes
- Line heights for readability
- Consistent heading styles

### 4. Color & Contrast

### 5. Interactive Elements
- All buttons have proper hover states

- Smooth transitions (not too slow)

## Files to Focus On
```

  page.tsx (landing page structure)

  tjenester/page.tsx (pricing page)

components/
  HeroA.tsx (PRIORITY - fix this first)
  CTA_A.tsx (call to action)
  PriceComparison.tsx (comparison table)
  StickyCTA.tsx (sticky bottom bar)
  AboutMe.tsx (about section)
  CaseA.tsx (case study)
```

- ❌ Don't change any marketing copy/text
- ❌ Don't add new features
- ❌ Don't change the tech stack
- ❌ Don't modify GDPR compliance
- ❌ Don't change the URL structure
- ❌ Don't add dependencies

## Deliverables

2. Consistent design system throughout
3. Perfect mobile experience
4. Clear visual hierarchy
5. Professional, trustworthy appearance
6. Ready for paid advertising launch

## Additional Context
- Target audience: Small/medium Norwegian businesses
- Main competitors: Traditional expensive agencies (50k-150k pricing)
- USP: Fast delivery (7-14 days), transparent pricing, personal service
- December special: 10,000 kr (normally 15,000 kr) - save 5,000 kr

Start with the Hero section pricing box - that's the most critical issue right now!
